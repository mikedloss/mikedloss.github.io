    <h1 class="title">Hello! Mike DLoss here.</h1>
    <p>
      I'm a <strong>Software Engineer</strong> and <strong>Creative Director</strong> at my church near Detroit, MI.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love coding with <strong>Javascript and Ruby</strong>, and building things with <strong>React, Angular, Node, and Ruby on Rails</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I use <strong>Angular and .NET</strong> every day at work at <strong>Quicken Loans</strong>. 
      My team mostly builds internal tools that do work and processes on <strong>99%</strong> of our loans.
      Some of our work is used in the client facing portion of our service through Rocket Mortgage.
    </p>
    <p>
      I like to build a lot of little side projects outside of work... 
      anything that'll <strong>provide value</strong> to the people around me. 
      Most of my work can be found on <a href="https://github.com/mikedloss" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GITHUB</a>.
      I'm passionate about <strong>UI and UX</strong>, and new emerging tech like <strong>GraphQL</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also <strong>volunteer</strong> as a <strong>Creative Director</strong> at my church.
      That involves <strong>leading a team</strong> of other volunteers and <strong>managing our in-house technology</strong>...
      things like our audio, video, and lighting systems.
    </p>
